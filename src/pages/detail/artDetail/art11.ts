    <p><strong>Megatrend in Post-Moore Law Period</strong></p>
    
    <p>Let’s revisit the Moore’s Law in the semiconductor industry: the density of integrated circuits doubles, and the cost halves every 18 months. This law has been maintained as sizes of integrated circuit devices have been shrinking for about 50 years. This law ends when CMOS reaches 40-28 nm, meaning that the previous physical theorem does not hold.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The next trend in the Post-Moore law period is the System on Heterogeneous Integration (SOH). In the future, heterogeneous integration is needed for chips with higher integration, performance, and power requirements. And ICLeague’s goal is to be the platform supporting the megatrends. SOH refers to the integration of different functional modules into a single chip using different integrated circuit processes by the 3D heterogeneous integration method. ICLeague grasped the trend more than three years ago when the company was founded.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Technology Breakthroughs accomplished by ICLeague</strong></p>
    
    <p>ICLeague is able to make high-performance chip because we have a great breakthrough in the Hybrid Bonding process. With the new Hybrid Bonding technology, it is possible to provide millions of connections from wafer to wafer directly, avoiding data transfer between different chips via data bus and switching data transmission between parallel or serial. Everything is combined together in one single chip.</p>
    
    <p>As Simon concludes, “We can not change the environment. The only thing that we can do is grasp all the potential opportunities and take a leap, even under great risk. Do nobody dare to do is the way we succeed.”</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Dive deep with ICLeauge&nbsp;</strong></p>
    
    <p>As Ms Cynthia Zhang summarizes our investment rationale in the closing remark, FutureX focuses on investing companies created by the next generation leaders who are building the future through technology innovation. ICLeague is the pioneer in the semiconductor industry. While “Copy Exactly” is the philosophy of many players in the industry, the team behind ICLeague has been innovating since the date of establishment. A team of serial entrepreneurs and industry veterans with commercialization experience is uncommon and precious in the deep tech space in China and in the entire world. We appreciate the mutual trust built between ICLeague and FutureX. FutureX Capital is currentlythe largest institutional shareholder since the first round of fundraising ofICLeague.</p>
