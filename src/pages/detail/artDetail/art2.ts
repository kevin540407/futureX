    <p><strong>1. Where does the greatest potential application opportunity for LLM lie?</strong></p>

    <p>The core of generational technological transformation lies in enhancing human well-being and meeting unfulfilled
        needs. From a perspective of sustainability and long-term business value, revolutionary technology should
        transcend material aspects and delve into improving all facets of human life quality. Historical technological
        revolutions, such as the industrial revolution and the rise of the mobile internet, primarily focused on
        optimizing material production and distribution, significantly enriching material resources and improving access
        to information. However, according to the annual World Happiness Report by the United Nations, factors
        influencing happiness are much more complex than just material wealth. The three critical factors include GDP
        per capita, social support, and the freedom to make life choices.</p>

    <p>Technological advancements have historically contributed to GDP per capita growth but have not adequately
        addressed needs related to social support and personal freedom. Over the past decade, even in major economies
        like the US and China, there has been a significant mismatch between overall happiness, GDP growth, and the pace
        of technological advancement. In this context, LLMs may find their most significant application
        potential—providing more personalized, in-depth products and services that engage with human emotions and
        spiritual realms, thereby fulfilling a deeper quest for quality of life.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Current Technological Limitations in Meeting Emotional and Social Needs</strong></p>

    <p>Despite notable advancements at the material level, technology still falls short in addressing deeper emotional
        and social needs. This gap is evident through several key social phenomena and data points:</p>

    <p>(a) Increasing Ubiquity of Loneliness: Statistics reveal that over 50% of Americans report feeling lonely, a
        significant increase from 3% in 1990 to 12% in 2020—a fourfold rise. This growth is driven by complex factors
        such as industrialization, urbanization, and population mobility, which have contributed to smaller work and
        family groups.</p>

    <p>(b) Cultural Pursuit of Independence: The cultural emphasis on individual independence and mobility has further
        intensified feelings of loneliness, underscoring a societal shift that often prioritizes personal freedom at the
        expense of communal ties.</p>

    <p>(c) Limitations of the Internet and Mobile Internet: While these technologies provide connectivity on a material
        level, their applications are lacking when it comes to addressing spiritual needs. Current offerings, such as
        games, videos, and social platforms, tend to stimulate short-term pleasure rather than fostering long-term
        emotional connections.</p>

    <p>(d) Superficial Social Media Relationships: Platforms such as Facebook and WeChat have historically promoted
        shallow social interactions, focusing on increasing followers and garnering likes rather than cultivating deep,
        meaningful relationships.</p>

    <p>(e) Lack of Genuine Social Relationships: Research estimates that only about 28% of friends on Facebook are
        genuine, with up to 40% being completely unknown "friends". The situation on WeChat is possibly even more dire,
        reflecting the superficial nature of connections formed on these platforms.</p>

    <p>These limitations highlight the need for technological solutions that can bridge the gap between material
        connectivity and genuine emotional and social fulfillment.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2010) is Becoming the New Opinion Leaders</strong></p>

    <p>Generation Z, born between 1995 and 2010, is increasingly shaping cultural and societal norms as the new opinion
        leaders, particularly noticeable in the tech sector and consumer-facing platforms. As individuals between the
        ages of 13 and 25, Gen Z is navigating crucial stages of mental development, value formation, and integration
        into the workforce. Known as "digital natives," Gen Z exhibits several unique cultural traits:</p>

    <p>(a) Intense Loneliness: Gen Z reports higher levels of loneliness compared to other age groups, with over 80%
        feeling isolated. This is often linked to social conditions and pervasive internet usage.</p>

    <p>(b) High Expectations for Spiritual Fulfillment: This generation values personalization and self-expression
        highly, striving to align themselves with groups that reflect their values of diversity and equality, indicating
        a mature value system focused on belonging.</p>

    <p>(c) Blurring Lines Between Digital and Real Worlds: Gen Z seamlessly integrates digital and real-world
        interactions. They are comfortable making friends online through platforms like Discord or following
        recommendations from bloggers for purchases. Their strong engagement with virtual idols and anime culture
        underscores their comfort with digital relationships and has significantly influenced related markets.</p>

    <p>In summary, Gen Z places a high priority on self-actualization and belonging, as outlined in Maslow's hierarchy
        of needs. With their comfort in digital environments and their strong demand for personalization and community,
        we may see the rise of hybrid social platforms in the future. These platforms would blend AI-driven digital
        companionship with real-world interactions, evolving into what is commonly referred to as "metaverse" social
        platforms.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Unlocking Commercial Potential Through Emotional Value</strong></p>

    <p>As major investment funds, large corporations, and startups intensify their focus on developing fundamental AGI
        (Artificial General Intelligence) models to boost business efficiency, the importance of addressing emotional
        value escalates. This strategic emphasis is unlocking vast commercial opportunities for platforms and products
        designed to meet complex emotional needs.</p>

    <p>In environments where emotional support is paramount, the adaptability and broad applicability of large language
        models (LLMs) shine. By prioritizing the development of AI systems with enhanced personification and emotional
        intelligence, these technologies offer personalized care and emotional support, often exceeding human
        capabilities. This progress is paving the way for innovative, emotion-centric platforms, including new forms of
        social media.</p>

    <p>The connection between commercial viability and cultural demands is unmistakable. As basic safety and
        physiological needs are met, individuals increasingly seek fulfillment in areas like belonging, esteem, and
        self-actualization. Addressing these needs through emotional value is crucial. The commercial potential of
        leveraging emotional engagement is manifest. For instance, in China, content-driven commerce has reached a
        turnover of 3 trillion RMB, while in the U.S., platforms like TikTok are driving rapid growth in the e-commerce
        sector, projected to reach 1 trillion USD. These platforms harness emotional engagement to transition young
        consumers from traditional need-based purchasing to content-driven and recommendation-led consumption.</p>

    <p>The market currently features a spectrum of AI-powered solutions that cater to emotional needs, which can be
        segmented into three main tiers:</p>

    <p>(a) Entertainment Extension: This fundamental level meets users' affinity for idols or animated characters,
        typically involving superficial interactions. Early versions of Character.ai utilized LLM personification
        techniques to foster continuous interaction with digital idols.</p>

    <p>(b) General Stress-Free Companionship: The second tier includes more extensive companionship functions, such as
        romance simulations and casual chatting, acting as a confidant. These products provide emotional support but
        typically establish only weak emotional connections.</p>

    <p>(c) Deep Emotional Communication: The most advanced tier requires AI models to engage in meaningful, heartfelt
        interactions, forging strong emotional bonds with users. This level of engagement depends on a profound
        understanding of human emotions and the ability to effectively address and alleviate them. Character.ai stands
        out in this tier, distinguished by its significant user engagement and its ability to deeply resonate with its
        audience.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, as AI technology continues to evolve, the market for products offering emotional companionship is
        progressively moving from mere entertainment to fostering deeper emotional connections.</p>

    <p>Further analysis reveals a predominant presence of users under 18 on Discord, making up 70% of this subgroup,
        with nearly all users being under 25. Character.ai enjoys a global user base, split approximately evenly across
        the U.S., Europe, and Asia, with over 90% of communication in English. The platform's users display diverse and
        enthusiastic interests, particularly in social activities related to gaming, art, and technology.</p>

    <p>Since 2017, the social and content platform landscape has been dominated by established giants like Facebook,
        YouTube, and Instagram, but these platforms are beginning to show signs of aging, particularly with declining
        engagement among younger users. Despite their continued use, this is largely due to the lack of viable
        alternatives. Although the user numbers for new entrants like Character.ai and other generative AI (GenAI)
        products still lag behind these industry titans, Character.ai has quickly proven its mettle by matching these
        giants in terms of user session length, even though it was launched less than a year ago. This positions it as a
        promising contender for the next-generation platform.</p>

    <p>The success of a platform can often be attributed to the founding team's vision and dedication. Character.ai
        benefits from a founding team that is not only technically adept—one of the founders helped develop the
        transformer model—but is also deeply committed to addressing the needs for companionship and emotional
        connection through AI. This focus is reflected in Character.ai's product offerings and business strategies. With
        a compact and highly skilled team of fewer than 40 people, primarily drawn from tech leaders like Google and
        Meta, Character.ai combines efficiency with execution prowess.</p>

    <p>Currently, the GenAI sector focused on emotional value is still in its infancy, hosting roughly 30 companies
        nationwide. Despite this, Character.ai stands out due to its breadth of offerings and developmental maturity.
        Its approach to universal applicability sets it apart from other products that may target niche areas like AI
        companions or specific types of chatbots.</p>

    <p>The application of AI in the emotional value sphere demands robust model capabilities, as the challenge lies in
        creating simulations that closely mimic human interaction—more demanding than mere operational efficiency.
        Although the market has yet to fully appreciate the potential of firms excelling in these capabilities, the
        significance of generative AI in this domain cannot be overstated, given its social impact, commercial
        viability, and attractiveness to investors. As a leading example in this field, Character.ai demonstrates the
        extensive possibilities of AI in enhancing human experiences. Its growing influence and the unfolding potential
        are expected to attract wider recognition and achieve a higher valuation in the future.</p>
