    <p>As an SFC licensed corporation, we take our fiduciary responsibility to consider and disclose all material
        factors that may impact the risk-adjusted returns of our investments, including climate-related financial risks
        and opportunities.</p>
    <p>As an investor in the global economy, the scale and multi-faceted nature of climate change presents a systemic
        risk to our portfolio. Climate change impacts investors like us in two main ways:</p>
   <p>Physical impacts (e.g. wildfires, extreme weather, sea-level rise, drought) can affect our fixed assets (e.g.
        real estate) and disrupt portfolio companies' supply chains and operations. Climate change's acute and chronic
        physical impacts can affect people's health, food security, migration, water supply, and other ecosystem
        services in ways that could bring heightened volatility to financial markets and harm economic growth.</p>
    <p>Transition risks, or shifts in policies, technologies, industries, and customers, due to changed climate norms or
        movement toward a lower-carbon economy can affect the financial success of existing business models and
        industries. Our portfolio companies' long-term success depends on the degree to which they can successfully
        navigate the transition.</p>
    <p>Given our investment portfolio, frequency of trading and investment scope, we take climate-related risks into

        and assess once a year or when any major changes such as changes in the fund’s investment strategy or investment
        horizon occurred. Disclosure will be updated and provided to the investors if necessary.</p>
    <p>For funds which are deemed to be relevant of climate-related risk, the Company will take into accounts
        climate-related risks when making investment analysis and risk management. The Company will take appropriate
        measures to identify, assesses, manage and monitor the investments which is relevant and material to the
        climate-related risks.</p>
    <p>Considering the investment strategy and scope of the investment portfolios, the Company prepared a
        Climate-related risk assessment Questionnaire in conducting the qualitative material assessment. The Company
        consider requesting private equity investment companies to fill in the climate-related risk assessment
        questionnaire so that the Company can understand and analyze the climate-related risk and controls, targets and
        future climate-related improvements process of the target private equity firms. The Company should conduct
        regular monitoring of the climate-related risk and therefore the result of the questionnaire should be updated
        annually.</p>
    <p>The Company should take extra steps to monitor the companies which belong to environmentally sensitive industries
        and therefore additional questions should be asked to collect more information from those companies.</p>
    <p>In light of the above, Board members are informed annually on climate-related risks and opportunities and how
        these may influence decisions in relation to risk management, strategy setting, implementation and monitoring.
